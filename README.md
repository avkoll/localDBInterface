The goal of this project is to create a NL2SQL LLM that can talk to a sql database. It will elminate the need to learn to write in SQL. 
This will of course be more complicated than I think, but I want this to follow the architecture below but replace the 
GPT stuff with local models.

# Models
### tscholak/cxmefzzi
This model is the T5-3B trained on the spider database and is fin tuned to be used something called PICARD \
I want to use this model and fine tune it on whatever database I will be 'talking' to. 

### meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct
This is llama, a bunch of things I read said this was one of the best to run locally and can run on a consumer pc \
I want to use the larger models but I only have a 2070 and don't think I would be able to run them. I need to save for a new pc \

# Architecture generated by chadgbd:
For the web app version of your application with GPT4All hosted on a local network, here’s an architecture that allows users to interact with the model and database through a browser while ensuring that the LLM is run on a fast PC to handle requests efficiently. Here’s how to approach it:

### Web App Architecture Overview:

1. **Frontend (Browser-Based)**
   - The frontend will be accessible to users through their web browsers while they are on the local network.
   - Technologies: **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**, **Flask** with **Jinja2** templates for rendering the UI, or **Dash** for interactive dashboards (as it integrates well with Flask).

2. **Backend (Server Hosted on Fast PC)**
   - **Flask** or **FastAPI** will serve the app and act as a bridge between the frontend, GPT4All model, and the database.
   - **GPT4All Model** will be loaded and served on this backend machine to handle natural language to SQL query generation.
   - **Database (SQL)**: Host your SQL database locally on the same server or a separate machine within the network.

3. **Local Network Access**
   - Users will access the web app from any device within the local network. The web app can be hosted on a **Fast PC (Server)**, which runs GPT4All for quick processing.

4. **Dashboard Page**
   - Users can create dashboards based on query results.
   - Technologies: Use **Plotly** or **Dash** for interactive charts and data visualizations.

### Key Components and Flow:

#### **1. Frontend:**
- Create a web interface with Flask and Jinja2 templates, or use Dash for a more dynamic interface.
- **Form Input**: Text input box where users type natural language queries.
- **Submit Button**: Sends the query to the backend.
- **Results Display**: Display SQL query results and, optionally, a table for dashboard creation.

Example using **Flask** and **Jinja2**:
```html
<form method="POST" action="/query">
  <label for="query">Enter your query:</label>
  <input type="text" id="query" name="query">
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>

<div>
  <!-- Display results dynamically here -->
</div>
```

#### **2. Backend:**
- **Flask/FastAPI** will manage the API endpoint for handling requests.
- When the user submits a query, the backend will:
  1. Fetch the **database schema**.
  2. Call **GPT4All** to generate the SQL query.
  3. Run the query on the SQL database.
  4. Return results to the frontend.

Example backend (using Flask):
```python
from flask import Flask, request, render_template
import gpt4all  # Example for GPT4All integration

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/query', methods=['POST'])
def handle_query():
    user_query = request.form['query']
    
    # Fetch database schema and prepare context
    schema = fetch_database_schema()
    gpt_prompt = f"Schema: {schema}\nUser Query: {user_query}"
    
    # Call GPT4All to generate SQL query
    sql_query = gpt4all.generate(gpt_prompt)
    
    # Execute the SQL query and fetch results
    result = execute_sql_query(sql_query)
    
    return render_template('results.html', result=result)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0')
```

#### **3. GPT4All Model Integration:**
- Run **GPT4All** on the backend machine, integrated with Flask/FastAPI. The model will process the natural language input and generate SQL.
- The GPT4All model should be loaded into memory at the start of the server, ensuring that requests are processed quickly.

Example GPT4All integration:
```python
import gpt4all

# Load the GPT4All model
gpt = gpt4all.GPT4All()

def generate_sql(query, schema):
    prompt = f"Schema: {schema}\nUser Query: {query}\nGenerate SQL:"
    response = gpt.generate(prompt)
    return response
```

#### **4. Dashboard Page:**
- Once the SQL query results are returned, users should be able to generate dashboards.
- **Plotly** or **Dash** can be used to create interactive charts from the data.

Example for rendering a dashboard (using **Plotly**):
```python
import plotly.express as px

def create_dashboard(data):
    df = pd.DataFrame(data)  # Convert query result to DataFrame
    fig = px.bar(df, x='column_x', y='column_y')
    return fig.to_html()  # Convert Plotly figure to HTML for embedding in Flask
```

In Flask, you can embed the dashboard directly in a page:
```python
@app.route('/dashboard')
def show_dashboard():
    data = fetch_data_for_dashboard()
    dashboard_html = create_dashboard(data)
    return render_template('dashboard.html', dashboard=dashboard_html)
```

#### **5. Local Network Access:**
- Deploy the web app on a powerful local server (Fast PC) within the network.
- The server’s IP address can be shared with users within the local network. They will be able to access the app using the local IP address.

For example, users can access the app via `http://192.168.x.x:5000`.

#### **6. Docker for Deployment:**
- Use Docker to encapsulate the Flask/FastAPI app, GPT4All model, and database for ease of deployment and scalability.

Example **Dockerfile** for the app:
```Dockerfile
FROM python:3.10

WORKDIR /app

COPY . /app

RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

CMD ["flask", "run", "--host=0.0.0.0"]
```

### Summary of the Architecture:
1. **Frontend**: Flask (or Dash) for natural language queries and dashboards.
2. **Backend**: Flask/FastAPI running on a fast local PC, handling the GPT4All model and SQL generation.
3. **Database**: Local SQL database, accessed through generated queries.
4. **Deployment**: Host the app on a local server, accessible by any user on the network. Docker can be used for packaging the app and making it portable.

This setup allows scalability, quick responses, and ensures the app runs efficiently, as it taps into a powerful backend. Would you like help with any specific part of this architecture?
